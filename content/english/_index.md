  title: "About Me"
  description: ""
  content: |
    I am a full professor of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies at TU Wien. My research
    aims to make security a design property—specified, verified, and certifiable—
    rather than an afterthought tested by audits.

    I work at the intersection of cryptography, formal methods, and systems, with
    the goal of building infrastructures that are both innovative and trustworthy.
    My contributions span password-hardened encryption and privacy-preserving
    analytics, secure ledgers and messaging protocols, and automated tools for
    formal certification.

    At stake is not only technical correctness but societal legitimacy: citizens
    must trust that their data is safe, that services will not collapse under
    attack, and that privacy is a guarantee, not a luxury.
