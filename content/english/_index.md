  title: "About Me"
  description: ""
  content: "
  I am a full professor of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies at TU Wien in Vienna.  
  My research aims to make security a design property — specified, verified, and certifiable — rather than an afterthought tested by audits.  
  <br/><br/>
  I work at the intersection of cryptography, formal methods, and systems, with the goal of building infrastructures that are both innovative and trustworthy. My contributions span password-hardened encryption and privacy-preserving analytics, secure ledgers and messaging protocols, and automated tools for formal certification.  
  <br/><br/>
  At stake is not only technical correctness but also societal legitimacy: citizens must trust that their data is safe, that services will not collapse under attack, and that privacy is a guarantee, not a luxury.  
  <br/><br/>
