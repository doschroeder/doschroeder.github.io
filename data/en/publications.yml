        abstract: "Threshold signatures are digital signature schemes in which a set of n signers specify a threshold t such that any subset of size t is authorized to produce signatures on behalf of the group. There has recently been a renewed interest in this primitive, largely driven by the need to secure highly valuable signing keys, e.g., DNSSEC keys or keys protecting digital wallets in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Of special interest is FROST, a practical Schnorr threshold signature scheme, which is currently undergoing standardization in the IETF and whose security was recently analyzed at CRYPTO 2022. We continue this line of research by focusing on FROSTs unforgeability combined with a practical distributed key generation (DKG) algorithm. Existing proofs of this setup either use non-standard heuristics, idealized group models like the AGM, or idealized key generation. Moreover, existing proofs do not consider all practical relevant optimizations that have been proposed. We close this gap between theory and practice by presenting the Schnorr threshold signature scheme Olaf, which combines the most efficient known FROST variant FROST3 with a variant of Pedersens DKG protocol (as commonly used for FROST), and prove its unforgeability. Our proof relies on the AOMDL assumption (a weaker and falsifiable variant of the OMDL assumption) and, like proofs of regular Schnorr signatures, on the random oracle model."

        abstract: "Everlasting security models the setting where hardness assumptions hold during the execution of a protocol but may get broken in the future. Due to the strength of this adversarial model, achieving any meaningful security guarantees for composable protocols is impossible without relying on hardware assumptions (Müller-Quade and Unruh, JoC'10). For this reason, a rich line of research has tried to leverage physical assumptions to construct well-known everlasting cryptographic primitives, such as commitment schemes. The only known everlastingly UC secure commitment scheme, due to Müller-Quade and Unruh (JoC'10), assumes honestly generated hardware tokens. The authors leave the possibility of constructing everlastingly UC secure commitments from malicious hardware tokens as an open problem. Goyal et al. (Crypto'10) constructs unconditionally UC-secure commitments and secure computation from malicious hardware tokens, with the caveat that the honest tokens must encapsulate other tokens. This extra restriction rules out interesting classes of hardware tokens, such as physically uncloneable functions (PUFs)."

        abstract:   "In the past few years blockchains have been a major focus for security research, resulting in significant progress in the design, formalization, and analysis of blockchain protocols. However, the more general class of distributed ledgers, which includes not just blockchains but also prominent non-blockchain protocols, such as Corda and OmniLedger, cannot be covered by the state-of-the-art in the security literature yet. These distributed ledgers often break with traditional blockchain paradigms, such as block structures to store data, system-wide consensus, or global consistency.
In this paper, we close this gap by proposing the first framework for defining and analyzing the security of general distributed ledgers, with an ideal distributed ledger functionality, called Fledger, at the core of our contribution. This functionality covers not only classical blockchains but also non-blockchain distributed ledgers in a unified way.
To illustrate Fledger, we first show that the prominent ideal blockchain functionalities Gledger and GPL realize (suitable instantia- tions of) Fledger, which captures their security properties. This implies that their respective implementations, including Bitcoin, Ouroboros Genesis, and Ouroboros Crypsinous, realize Fledger as well. Secondly, we demonstrate that Fledger is capable of precisely modeling also non-blockchain distributed ledgers by performing the first formal security analysis of such a distributed ledger, namely the prominent Corda protocol. Due to the wide spread use of Corda in industry, in particular the financial sector, this analysis is of independent interest.
These results also illustrate that Fledger not just generalizes the modular treatment of blockchains to distributed ledgers, but moreover helps to unify existing results."

        abstract:  "CoinJoin is the predominant means to enhance privacy in non-private cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.
The basic idea of CoinJoin is to create transactions that combine equal-valued coins of multiple users. This mixing of coins aims to prevent linkage of the users' transactional in- and outputs.
The cryptocurrency Dash employs a built-in CoinJoin service and, therefore, is ideal for empirically studying CoinJoin. 
This paper presents the first empirical analysis of Dash, which reveals that over 40% of all private transactions can be de-anonymized depending on underlying assumptions. The main issue of these attacks is the coin-aggregation problem, i.e.\ the need to combine outputs of several CoinJoin transactions. 
The coin aggregation problem is not specific to Dash and affects other cryptocurrencies as empirical evidence in Bitcoin suggests.
We show that the logical solution to the problem, namely CoinJoin transactions with non-fixed arbitrary values, suffers from other privacy weaknesses.
We propose a novel mixing algorithm to mitigate the need for coin aggregation without introducing additional privacy vulnerabilities. In contrast to prior mixing algorithms, our approach removes the need for fixed values by dynamically creating equal-valued CoinJoin transactions.
The mixing algorithm is not specific to Dash, and integration into other cryptocurrencies, especially into Bitcoin, is possible."

        abstract: "A ring signature scheme allows the signer to sign on behalf of an ad hoc set of users, called a ring. The verifier can be convinced that a ring member signs, but cannot point to the exact signer. Ring signatures have become increasingly important today with their deployment in anonymous cryptocurrencies. Conventionally, it is implicitly assumed that all ring members are equally likely to be the signer. This assumption is generally false in reality, leading to various practical and devastating deanonymizing attacks in Monero, one of the largest anonymous cryptocurrencies. These attacks highlight the unsatisfactory situation that how a ring should be chosen is poorly understood.
        
We propose an analytical model of ring samplers towards a deeper understanding of them through systematic studies. Our model helps to describe how anonymous a ring sampler is with respect to a given signer distribution as an information-theoretic measure. We show that this measure is robust, in the sense that it only varies slightly when the signer distribution varies slightly. We then analyze three natural samplers – uniform, mimicking, and partitioning
– under our model with respect to a family of signer distributions modeled after empirical Bitcoin data. We hope that our work paves the way towards researching ring samplers from a theoretical point of view.

        abstract:  "A verifiable timed signature (VTS) scheme allows one to time-lock a signature on a known message for a given amount of time T such that after performing a sequential computation for time T anyone can extract the signature from the time-lock. Verifiability ensures that anyone can publicly check if a time-lock contains a valid signature on the message without solving it first, and that the signature can be obtained by solving the same for time T.
This work formalizes VTS, presents efficient constructions compatible with BLS, Schnorr, and ECDSA signatures, and experimentally demonstrates that these constructions can be employed in practice. On a technical level, we design an efficient cut-and-choose protocol based on the homomorphic time-lock puzzles to prove the validity of a signature encapsulated in a time-lock puzzle. We also present a new efficient range proof protocol that significantly improves upon existing proposals in terms of the proof size, and is also of independent interest.
While VTS is a versatile tool with numerous existing applications, we demonstrate VTS’s applicability to resolve three novel challenging issues in the space of cryptocurrencies. Specif- ically, we show how VTS is the cryptographic cornerstone to construct: (i) Payment channel networks with improved on-chain unlinkability of users involved in a transaction, (ii) multi- party signing of transactions for cryptocurrencies without any on-chain notion of time and (iii) cryptocurrency-enabled fair multi-party computation protocol."

Furthermore, the test patients were asked about their opinion and their concerns on the PROMISE app. Most of the 19 test patients were aware of the high sensibility of genomic data and thought that the PROMISE app was a suitable solution.

        abstract: "A recent line of work has explored the use of physically uncloneable functions (PUFs) for secure computation, with the goals of (1) achieving universal composability without additional setup, and/or (2) obtaining unconditional security (i.e., avoiding complexity-theoretic assump- tions). Initial work assumed that all PUFs, even those created by an attacker, are honestly generated. Subsequently, researchers have investigated models in which an adversary can create malicious PUFs with arbitrary behavior. Researchers have considered both malicious PUFs that might be stateful, as well as malicious PUFs that can have arbitrary behavior but are guaranteed to be stateless.
We settle the main open questions regarding secure computation in the malicious-PUF model: 
--  We prove that unconditionally secure oblivious transfer is impossible, even in the stand-
alone setting, if the adversary can construct (malicious) stateful PUFs.
--  If the attacker is limited to creating (malicious) stateless PUFs, then universally compos-
able two-party computation is possible without computational assumptions."

        abstract:  "An individual’s genetic information is pos- sibly the most valuable personal information. While knowledge of a person’s DNA sequence can facilitate the diagnosis of several heritable diseases and allow per- sonalized treatment, its exposure comes with significant threats to the patient’s privacy. Currently known so- lutions for privacy-respecting computation require the owner of the DNA to either be heavily involved in the execution of a cryptographic protocol or to completely outsource the access control to a third party. This mo- tivates the demand for cryptographic protocols which enable computation over encrypted genomic data while keeping the owner of the genome in full control. We envi- sion a scenario where data owners can exercise arbitrary and dynamic access policies, depending on the intended use of the analysis results and on the credentials of who is conducting the analysis. At the same time, data own- ers are not required to maintain a local copy of their entire genetic data and do not need to exhaust their computational resources in an expensive cryptographic protocol.
In this work, we present METIS, a system that assists the computation over encrypted data stored in the cloud while leaving the decision on admissible computa- tions to the data owner. It is based on garbled circuits and supports any polynomially-computable function. A critical feature of our system is that the data owner is free from computational overload and her communica- tion complexity is independent of the size of the input data and only linear in the size of the circuit’s output. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach with an implementation and an evaluation of several functions over real datasets.

        abstract: "The Schnorr signature scheme is the most efficient signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem and a long line of research investigates the existence of a tight security reduction for this scheme in the random oracle model. Almost all re- cent works present lower tightness bounds and most recently Seurin (Eurocrypt 2012) showed that under certain assumptions the non-tight security proof for Schnorr sig- natures in the random oracle by Pointcheval and Stern (Eurocrypt 1996) is essentially optimal. All previous works in this direction rule out tight reductions from the (one- more) discrete logarithm problem. In this paper we introduce a new meta-reduction technique, which shows lower bounds for the large and very natural class of generic reductions. A generic reduction is independent of a particular representation of group elements. Most reductions in state-of-the-art security proofs have this property. It is desirable, because then the reduction applies generically to any concrete instantiation of the group. Our approach shows unconditionally that there is no tight generic reduc- tion from any natural non-interactive computational problem Π defined over algebraic groups to breaking Schnorr signatures, unless solving Π is easy.
In an additional application of the new meta-reduction technique, we also uncon- ditionally rule out any (even non-tight) generic reduction from natural non-interactive computational problems defined over algebraic groups to breaking Schnorr signatures in the non-programmable random oracle model."

        abstract: "We continue the line of work initiated by Katz (Eurocrypt 2007) on using tamper-proof hardware tokens for universally composable secure computation. As our main result, we show an oblivious-transfer (OT) protocol in which two parties each create and exchange a single, stateless token and can then run an unbounded number of OTs. We also show a more efficient protocol, based only on standard symmetric-key primitives (block ciphers and collision-resistant hash functions), that can be used if a bounded number of OTs suffice.

Motivated by this result, we investigate the number of stateless tokens needed for universally composable OT. We prove that our protocol is optimal in this regard for constructions making black-box use of the tokens (in a sense we define). We also show that nonblack-box techniques can be used to obtain a construction using only a single stateless token."

        abstract: "Cloud storage has rapidly become a cornerstone of many IT infrastructures, constituting a seamless solution for the backup, synchronization, and sharing of large amounts of data. Putting user data in the direct control of cloud service providers, however, raises security and privacy concerns related to the integrity of outsourced data, the accidental or intentional leakage of sensitive information, the profiling of user activities and so on. Furthermore, even if the cloud provider is trusted, users having access to outsourced files might be malicious and misbehave. These concerns are particularly serious in sensitive applications like personal health records and credit score systems.
To tackle this problem, we present GORAM, a cryptographic system that protects the se- crecy and integrity of outsourced data with respect to both an untrusted server and malicious clients, guarantees the anonymity and unlinkability of accesses to such data, and allows the data owner to share outsourced data with other clients, selectively granting them read and write per- missions. GORAM is the first system to achieve such a wide range of security and privacy properties for outsourced storage. In the process of designing an efficient construction, we de- veloped two new, generally applicable cryptographic schemes, namely, batched zero-knowledge proofs of shuffle and an accountability technique based on chameleon signatures, which we con- sider of independent interest. We implemented GORAM in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and ran a performance evaluation demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of our construction."

Our construction relies on any degree-k (multi-key) homomorphic encryption scheme and can evaluate degree-((k + 1)m − 1) polynomials, for any polynomial number of inputs n and any sub-logarithmic (in the security parameter) number of servers m. At the heart of our work is a series of combinatorial arguments on how a polynomial can be split into several low-degree polynomials over the shares of the inputs, which we believe is of independent interest."

        abstract: "In a sanitizable signature scheme the signer allows a designated third party, called the sanitizer, to modify certain parts of the message and adapt the signature accordingly. Ateniese et al. (ESORICS 2005) introduced this primitive and proposed five security properties which were formalized by Brzuska et al. (PKC 2009). Subsequently, Brzuska et al. (PKC 2010) suggested an additional security notion, called unlinkability which says that one cannot link sanitized message-signature pairs of the same document. Moreover, the authors gave a generic con- struction based on group signatures that have a certain structure. How- ever, the special structure required from the group signature scheme only allows for inefficient instantiations.
Here, we present the first efficient instantiation of unlinkable sanitiz- able signatures. Our construction is based on a novel type of signature schemes with re-randomizable keys. Intuitively, this property allows to re-randomize both the signing and the verification key separately but consistently. This allows us to sign the message with a re-randomized key and to prove in zero-knowledge that the derived key originates from either the signer or the sanitizer. We instantiate this generic idea with Schnorr signatures and efficient Σ-protocols, which we convert into non- interactive zero-knowledge proofs via the Fiat-Shamir transformation. Our construction is at least one order of magnitude faster than instanti- ating the generic scheme of Brzuska et al. with the most efficient group signature schemes."

        abstract: "We introduce delegatable functional signatures (DFS) which support the delegation of signing capabilities to another party, called the evaluator, with respect to a functionality F. In a DFS, the signer of a message can choose an evaluator, specify how the evaluator can modify the signature without voiding its validity, allow additional input and decide how the evaluator can further delegate its capabilities.
The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose DFS, a novel cryptographic primitive that unifies several seemingly different signature primitives, including functional sig- natures as defined by Boyle, Goldwasser, and Ivan (eprint 2013/401), sanitizable signatures, identity based signatures, and blind signatures. To achieve this unification, we present several definitions of unforgeability and privacy. Finding appropriate and meaningful definitions in this context is challenging due to the natural mealleability of DFS and due to the multi-party setting that may involve malicious keys.
Second, we present a complete characterization of the instantiability of DFS under common assumptions, like the existence of one-way functions. Here, we present both positive and negative results. On the positive side we show that DFS not achieving our notion of privacy can be constructed from one-way functions. Furthermore, we show that unforgerable and private DFS can be constructed from doubly enhanced trapdoor permutations. On the negative side we show that the previous result is optimal regarding its underlying assumptions presenting an impossibility result for unforgeable private DFS from one-way permutations."

        abstract:   "The Schnorr signature scheme is the most efficient signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem and a long line of research investigates the existence of a tight security reduction for this scheme in the random oracle model. Almost all re- cent works present lower tightness bounds and most recently Seurin (Eurocrypt 2012) showed that under certain assumptions the non-tight security proof for Schnorr sig- natures in the random oracle by Pointcheval and Stern (Eurocrypt 1996) is essentially optimal. All previous works in this direction rule out tight reductions from the (one- more) discrete logarithm problem. In this paper we introduce a new meta-reduction technique, which shows lower bounds for the large and very natural class of generic reductions. A generic reduction is independent of a particular representation of group elements. Most reductions in state-of-the-art security proofs have this property. It is desirable, because then the reduction applies generically to any concrete instantiation of the group. Our approach shows unconditionally that there is no tight generic reduc- tion from any natural non-interactive computational problem Π defined over algebraic groups to breaking Schnorr signatures, unless solving Π is easy.
In an additional application of the new meta-reduction technique, we also uncon- ditionally rule out any (even non-tight) generic reduction from natural non-interactive computational problems defined over algebraic groups to breaking Schnorr signatures in the non-programmable random oracle model."

        abstract:   "We continue the line of work initiated by Katz (Eurocrypt 2007) on using tamper-proof hardware tokens for universally composable secure computation. As our main result, we show an oblivious-transfer (OT) protocol in which two parties each create and exchange a single, stateless token and can then run an unbounded number of OTs. We also show a more efficient protocol, based only on standard symmetric-key primitives (block ciphers and collision-resistant hash functions), that can be used if a bounded number of OTs suffice.

Motivated by this result, we investigate the number of stateless tokens needed for universally composable OT. We prove that our protocol is optimal in this regard for constructions making black-box use of the tokens (in a sense we define). We also show that nonblack-box techniques can be used to obtain a construction using only a single stateless token."

        abstract: "Cloud storage has rapidly acquired popularity among users, constituting a seamless solution for the backup, synchronization, and sharing of large amounts of data. This technology, however, puts user data in the direct control of cloud service providers, which raises increasing security and privacy concerns related to the integrity of outsourced data, the accidental or intentional leakage of sensitive information, the profiling of user activities and so on. We present GORAM, a cryptographic system that protects the secrecy and integrity of the data outsourced to an untrusted server and guarantees the anonymity and unlinkability of consecutive accesses to such data. GORAM allows the database owner to share outsourced data with other clients, selectively granting them read and write permissions. GORAM is the first system to achieve such a wide range of security and privacy properties for outsourced storage. Technically, GORAM builds on a combination of ORAM to conceal data accesses, attribute-based encryption to rule the access to outsourced data, and zero-knowledge proofs to prove read and write permissions in a privacy-preserving manner. We implemented GORAM and conducted an experimental evaluation to demonstrate its feasibility."

We aim to make another step towards a tighter integration of digital cryptography into real world interactions. We describe Ubic, a framework that allows users to bridge the gap between digital cryptography and the physical world. Ubic relies on head-mounted displays, like Google Glass, resource-friendly computer vision techniques as well as mathematically sound cryptographic primitives to provide users with better security and privacy guarantees. The framework covers key cryptographic primitives, such as secure identification, document verification using a novel secure physical document format, as well as content hiding. To make a contribution of practical value, we focused on making Ubic as simple, easily deployable, and user friendly as possible."

        abstract:   "In a verifiable data streaming protocol, the client streams a long string to the server who stores it in its database. The stream is verifiable in the sense that the server can neither change the order of the elements nor manipulate them. The client may also retrieve data from the database and update them. The content of the database is publicly verifiable such that any party in possession of some value s and a proof π can check that s is indeed in the database.
We introduce the notion of verifiable data streaming and present an efficient instantiation that supports an exponential number of values based on general assumptions. Our main technique is an authentication tree in which the leaves are not fixed in advanced such that the user, knowing some trapdoor, can authenticate a new element on demand without pre- or re-computing all other leaves. We call this data structure chameleon authentication tree (CAT). We instantiate our scheme with primitives that are secure under the discrete logarithm assumption. The algebraic properties of this assumption allow us to obtain a very efficient verification algorithm. As a second application of CATs, we present a new transformation from any one-time to many-time signature scheme that is more efficient than previously known solutions."

Here we discuss the idea for signatures where the new aggregate does not rely on the pre- vious messages and public keys either, thus inhibiting the costly verifications in each aggregation step as in previous schemes by Lysyanskaya et al. (Eurocrypt 2004) and Neven (Eurocrypt 2008). Analogously to MACs we argue about new security definitions for such schemes and compare them to previous notions for history-dependent schemes. We finally give a construction based on the BLS signature scheme which satisfies our notion."

        abstract: "We explore the security of blind signatures under aborts where the user or the signer may stop the interactive signature issue protocol prematurely. Several works on blind signatures discuss security only in regard of completed executions and usually do not impose strong security requirements in case of aborts. One of the exceptions is the paper of Camenisch, Neven and shelat (Eurocrypt 2007) where the no- tion of selective-failure blindness has been introduced. Roughly speaking, selective-failure blindness says that blindness should also hold in case the signer is able to learn that some executions have aborted.
        Here we augment the work of Camenisch et al. by showing how to turn every secure blind signature scheme into a selective-failure blind signa- ture scheme. Our transformation only requires an additional computa- tion of a commitment and therefore adds only a negligible overhead. We also study the case of multiple executions and notions of selective-failure blindness in this setting. We then discuss the case of user aborts and unforgeability under such aborts. We show that every three-move blind signature scheme remains unforgeable under such user aborts. Together with our transformation for selective-failure blindness we thus obtain an easy solution to ensure security under aborts of either party and which is applicable for example to the schemes of Pointcheval and Stern (Journal of Cryptology, 2000).
        We finally revisit the construction of Camenisch et al. for simulatable adaptive oblivious transfer protocols, starting from selective-failure blind signatures where each message only has one valid signature (uniqueness). While our transformation to achieve selective-failure blindness does not preserve uniqueness, it can still be combined with a modified version of their protocol. Hence, we can derive such oblivious transfer proto- cols based on unique blind signature schemes only (in the random ora- cle model), without necessarily requiring selective-failure blindness from scratch.

        abstract:   "A seminal result in cryptography is that signature schemes can be constructed (in a black-box fashion) from any one-way function. The minimal assumptions needed to construct blind signature schemes, however, have remained unclear. Here, we rule out black-box construc- tions of blind signature schemes from one-way functions. In fact, we rule out constructions even from a random permutation oracle, and our re- sults hold even for blind signature schemes for 1-bit messages that achieve security only against honest-but-curious behavior."

        abstract:  "We present an aggregate signature scheme whose public key consists of only two group elements. It is therefore the first sequential ag- gregate signature scheme with short keys in the standard model. Our con- struction relies on the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature scheme (Crypto 2004) and is provably secure under the LRSW assumption. Moreover, we develop a novel aggregation technique that we call aggregate-extension technique. The basic idea is to extend the aggregate by a single element and to use this additional space to “store” some information that would be lost due to the compression of the signatures. We believe that this technique might be of independent interest"

        abstract:  "Non-malleability of a cryptographic primitive is a fundamental security property which ensures some sort of independence of cryptographic values. The notion has been extensively studied for commitments, encryption and zero-knowledge proofs, but it was not until recently that the notion—and its peculiarities— have been considered for hash functions by Boldyreva et al. (Asiacrypt 2009). They give a simulation-based definition, basically saying that for any adversary mauling hash values into related ones there is a simulator which is as successful in producing such hash values, even when not seeing the original hash values. Their notion, although following previous approaches to non-malleability, is nonetheless quite unwieldy; it is hard to achieve and, due to the existential quantification over the simulator, hard to falsify. We also note that finding an equivalent indistinguishability-based notion is still open.
Here we take a different, more handy approach to non-malleability of hash functions. Our definition avoids simulators completely and rather asks the adversary to maul the hash value and to also specify a transfor- mation φ of the pre-image, taken from a fixed class Φ of admissible transformations. These transformations are usually determined by group operations and include such cases such as exclusive-ors (i.e., bit flips) and modular additions. We then simply demand that the probability of succeeding is negligible, as long as the original pre-image carries enough entropy. We continue to show that our notion is useful by proving that, for example, the strengthened Merkle-Damg ̊ard transformation meets our notion for the case of bit flips, as- suming an ideal compression function. We also improve over the security result by Boldyreva et al., showing that our notion of non-malleability suffices for the security of the Bellare-Rogaway encryption scheme."

        abstract: "We investigate the possibility to prove security of the well- known blind signature schemes by Chaum, and by Pointcheval and Stern in the standard model, i.e., without random oracles. We subsume these schemes under a more general class of blind signature schemes and show that finding security proofs for these schemes via black-box reductions in the standard model is hard. Technically, our result deploys meta- reduction techniques showing that black-box reductions for such schemes could be turned into efficient solvers for hard non-interactive crypto- graphic problems like RSA or discrete-log. Our approach yields signif- icantly stronger impossibility results than previous meta-reductions in other settings by playing off the two security requirements of the blind signatures (unforgeability and blindness).

        abstract: "Sanitizable signatures allow a designated party, called the sanitizer, to modify parts of signed data such that the immutable parts can still be verified with respect to the original signer. Ateniese et al. (ES- ORICS 2005) discuss five security properties for such signature schemes: unforgeability, immutability, privacy, transparency and accountability. These notions have been formalized in a recent work by Brzuska et al. (PKC 2009), discussing also the relationships among the security no- tions. In addition, they prove a modification of the scheme of Ateniese et al. to be secure according to these notions.
Here we discuss that a sixth property of sanitizable signature schemes may be desirable: unlinkability. Basically, this property prevents that one can link sanitized message-signature pairs of the same document, thus allowing to deduce combined information about the original document. We show that this notion implies privacy, the inability to recover the original data of sanitized parts, but is not implied by any of the other five notions. We also discuss a scheme based on group signatures meeting all six security properties."

        abstract:  "Encrypt-and-sign, where one encrypts and signs a message in parallel, is usually not recommended for confidential message transmission. The reason is that the signature typically leaks information about the message. This motivates our investigation of confiden- tial signature schemes, which hide all information about (high-entropy) input messages. In this work we provide a formal treatment of confidentiality for such schemes and a compre- hensive discussion of the relationship of different notions we propose. We give constructions meeting our notions, both in the random oracle model and the standard model. As part of this we show that full domain hash signatures achieve a weaker level of confidentiality than Fiat-Shamir signatures. We then revisit the connection of confidential signatures to sign- cryption schemes. We give formal security models for deterministic signcryption schemes for high-entropy and low-entropy messages, and prove encrypt-and-sign to be secure for confidential signature schemes and high-entropy messages. Finally, we show that one can derandomize any signcryption scheme in our model and obtain a secure deterministic scheme."

An example is given by signed XML documents of which parts should be sanitized before being published by a distributor not holding the signing key. Kundu and Bertino also provide a construc- tion, but fall short of providing formal security definitions and proofs. Here we revisit their work and give rigorous security models for the redactable signatures for tree-structured data, relate the notions, and give a construction that can be proven secure under standard cryptographic assumptions."

        abstract:  "Aggregate message authentication codes, as introduced by Katz and Lindell (CT-RSA 2008), combine several MACs into a single value, which has roughly the same size as an ordinary MAC. These schemes reduce the communication overhead significantly and are therefore a promising approach to achieve authenticated communication in mobile ad-hoc networks, where communication is prohibitively expensive. Here we revisit the unforgeability notion for aggregate MACs and discuss that the definition does not prevent “mix-and-match” attacks in which the adversary turns several aggregates into a “fresh” combination, i.e., into a valid aggregate on a sequence of messages which the attacker has not requested before. In particular, we show concrete attacks on the previous scheme.

To capture the broader class of combination attacks, we provide a stronger security notion of aggregation unforgeability. While we can provide stateful transformations lifting (non-ordered) schemes to meet our stronger security notion, for the statefree case we switch to the new notion of history-free sequential aggregation. This notion is somewhat between non-ordered and sequential schemes and basically says that the aggregation algorithm is carried out in a sequential order but must not depend on the preceding messages in the sequence, but only on the shorter input aggregate and the local message. We finally show that we can build an aggregation-unforgeable, history-free sequential MAC scheme based on general assumptions.

        abstract:  "It is well-known that blind signature schemes provide full anonymity for the receiving user. For many real-world applications, however, this leaves too much room for fraud. There are two generalizations of blind signature schemes that compensate this weakness: fair blind signatures and partially blind signatures. Fair blind signature schemes allow a trusted third party to revoke blindness in case of a dispute. In partially blind signature schemes, the signer retains a certain control over the signed message because signer and user have to agree on a specific part of the signed message.

In this work, we unify the previous well-studied models into a generalization, called fair partially blind signatures. We propose an instantiation that is secure in the standard model without any setup assumptions. With this construction, we also give a positive answer to the open question of whether fair blind signature schemes in the standard model exist."

        abstract:   "Public-key encryption schemes with non-interactive opening (PKENO) allow a receiver to non-interactively convince third parties that a ciphertext decrypts to a given plaintext or, alternatively, that such a ciphertext is invalid. Two practical generic constructions for PKENO have been proposed so far, starting from either identity-based encryption or public-key encryption with witness-recovering decryption (PKEWR). We show that the known transformation from PKEWR to PKENO fails to provide chosen-ciphertext security; only the transformation from identity-based encryption remains thus valid. Next, we prove that PKENO can alternatively be built out of robust non-interactive threshold public-key cryptosystems, a primitive that differs from identity-based encryption. Using the new transformation, we construct two efficient PKENO schemes: one based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (in the Random-Oracle Model) and one based on the Decisional Linear assumption (in the standard model). Last but not least, we propose new applications of PKENO in protocol design. Motivated by these applications, we reconsider proof soundness for PKENO and put forward new definitions that are stronger than those considered so far. We give a taxonomy of all definitions and demonstrate them to be satisfiable."

The most common CAPTCHAs today are text-based ones where a short word is embedded in a cluttered image. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art of currently deployed CAPTCHAs, especially of some popular German sites. Surprisingly, despite their importance and the large- scale deployment, most of the CAPTCHAs like the ones of the “Umweltpra ̈mie”, the Bundesfinanzagentur, and the Sparda-Bank are rather weak. Our results show that these CAPTCHAs are subject to automated attacks solving up to 80% of the puzzles. Furthermore, we suggest design criteria for “good” CAPTCHAs and for the system using them. In light of this we revisit the popular reCAPTCHA system and latest developments about its security. Finally, we discuss some alternative approaches for CAPTCHAs.

        type: 0
        abstract: "We explore the security of blind signatures under aborts where the user or the signer may stop the interactive signature issue protocol prematurely. Several works on blind signatures discuss security only in regard of completed executions and usually do not impose strong security requirements in case of aborts. One of the exceptions is the paper of Camenisch, Neven and shelat (Eurocrypt 2007) where the no- tion of selective-failure blindness has been introduced. Roughly speaking, selective-failure blindness says that blindness should also hold in case the signer is able to learn that some executions have aborted.
Here we augment the work of Camenisch et al. by showing how to turn every secure blind signature scheme into a selective-failure blind signa- ture scheme. Our transformation only requires an additional computa- tion of a commitment and therefore adds only a negligible overhead. We also study the case of multiple executions and notions of selective-failure blindness in this setting. We then discuss the case of user aborts and unforgeability under such aborts. We show that every three-move blind signature scheme remains unforgeable under such user aborts. Together with our transformation for selective-failure blindness we thus obtain an easy solution to ensure security under aborts of either party and which is applicable for example to the schemes of Pointcheval and Stern (Journal of Cryptology, 2000).
We finally revisit the construction of Camenisch et al. for simulatable adaptive oblivious transfer protocols, starting from selective-failure blind signatures where each message only has one valid signature (uniqueness). While our transformation to achieve selective-failure blindness does not preserve uniqueness, it can still be combined with a modified version of their protocol. Hence, we can derive such oblivious transfer proto- cols based on unique blind signature schemes only (in the random ora- cle model), without necessarily requiring selective-failure blindness from scratch"

        abstract:  "Sanitizable signature schemes, as defined by Ateniese et al. (ESORICS 2005), allow a signer to partly delegate signing rights to an- other party, called the sanitizer. That is, the sanitizer is able to modify a predetermined part of the original message such that the integrity and authenticity of the unchanged part is still verifiable. Ateniese et al. identify five security requirements for such schemes (unforgeability, immutability, privacy, transparency and accountability) but do not pro- vide formal specifications for these properties. They also present a scheme that is supposed to satisfy these requirements.
Here we revisit the security requirements for sanitizable signatures and, for the first time, present a comprehensive formal treatment. Besides a full characterization of the requirements we also investigate the relation- ship of the properties, showing for example that unforgeability follows from accountability. We then provide a full security proof for a modifi- cation of the original scheme according to our model."

        abstract: "In a verifiably encrypted signature scheme, signers encrypt their signature under the public key of a trusted third party and prove that they did so correctly. The security properties, due to Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt 2003), are unforgeability and opacity.

This paper proposes two novel fundamental requirements for verifiably encrypted signatures, called extractability and abuse-freeness, and analyzes its effects on the established security model. Extractability ensures that the trusted third party is always able to extract a valid signature from a valid verifiably encrypted signature and abuse-freeness guarantees that a malicious signer, who cooperates with the trusted party, is not able to forge a verifiably encrypted signature. We further show that both properties are not covered by the model of Boneh et al. The second main contribution of this paper is a verifiably encrypted signature scheme, provably secure without random oracles, that is more efficient and greatly improves the public key size of the only other construction in the standard model by Lu et al. (Eurocrypt 2006). Moreover, we present strengthened definitions for unforgeability and opacity in the spirit of strong unforgeability of digital signature schemes."
