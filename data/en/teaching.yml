    - title : Cryptography for Computer Scientist
      semester : Winter term 22/23
      turnus : BSC/MSC (WS)
      content: "Cryptography is the science of protecting information in computing systems. The application of cryptographic techniques ranges from classical areas, such as protecting data in rest and transit, to authentication, verifiable computation, and secure multi-party computation. This course gives an in-depth introduction to cryptography for computer scientists. The lecture establishes the mathematical basics and formalization of security notions as cryptographic games. Afterward, it introduces private-key encryption with the corresponding security definitions and constructions based on generic building blocks. Further, symmetric-key primitives such as hash functions and message authentication codes are covered. The second part of the lecture covers public-key primitives, such as key-exchange, public-key encryption, and digital signatures. "

    - title : Data Privacy I / II
      semester : Winter term 22/23
      turnus : BSC/MSC (WS)
      content: "Data privacy is a crucial aspect of the digital world, protecting personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access or misuse. The lecture covers several topics related to data privacy, including reconstruction attacks, k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness, differential privacy, oblivious RAM, and private-information retrieval.

Reconstruction attacks are methods used to compromise data privacy by reassembling information from different sources. k-Anonymity is a method that protects data privacy by ensuring that no single record can be linked to a specific individual. l-Diversity and t-Closeness are extensions of k-Anonymity that offer greater protection by taking into account the diversity of information in a dataset.

Differential privacy is a technique used to protect data privacy by adding noise to the data before it is shared. Oblivious RAM protects data privacy by ensuring that data is not accessible to unauthorized parties, even if the storage media is stolen or compromised. Private-Information Retrieval is a method that protects data privacy by allowing users to retrieve information from a database without revealing which information was retrieved."

    - title : Cryptocurrencies I / II
      semester : Winter term 22/23
      turnus : BSC/MSC (WS)
      content: "The lecture on modern cryptocurrencies covers the fundamentals of mathematics, cryptography and cryptocurrencies. It starts with a basic understanding of groups and probability theory, which form the basis of cryptography. It then explains the concepts of encryption, digital signatures and hash functions.

The lecture focuses on cryptocurrencies and introduces the topic, covering their workings and different types. It explores Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, and its underlying architecture, the Bitcoin Backbone, as well as its use as a store of value, means of payment and speculative asset.

The lecture compares and contrasts the two main consensus mechanisms, Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, and covers payment channels and the anonymity aspect of Bitcoin.

Overall, the lecture provides a comprehensive introduction to modern cryptocurrencies and serves as a strong foundation for further study."

#     - title : Cryptocurrencies II
#       semester : Winter term 22/23
#       turnus : BSC/MSC (WS)
#       content: "The second lecture builds on the previous one by focusing on the privacy aspects of modern cryptocurrencies. It covers cryptocurrencies such as ZCash and Monero, two cryptocurrencies that place a strong emphasis on privacy and security. The lecture explains the underlying cryptographic primitives such as ring confidential transactions and the use of efficient proof systems, such as non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems, which allow for secure and confidential transactions.

# The lecture provides a deeper understanding of the technical details behind privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and explains how they achieve a higher degree of privacy compared to traditional cryptocurrencies. 

# In conclusion, the second lecture provides a more in-depth understanding of the privacy aspects of modern cryptocurrencies and their potential impact on the financial world. It serves as a valuable resource for those who want to learn more about the cryptographic techniques used to achieve privacy in digital transactions."
