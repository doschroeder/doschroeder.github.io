  title: Brief Bio
  description: I joined the University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg in 2016. My research interests are in applied cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies. Before joining FAU, I was a student at the Technical University of Darmstadt and a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland. From 2012 to 2015, I was a professor at Saarland University. My research received several awards, such as the humboldt Feodor Lynen research fellowship or the Intel Early Career Faculty Award. I served as an independent (privacy) expert in the Bundestag Health Committee.
