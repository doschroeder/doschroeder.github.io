  title: Brief Bio
  description:In the summer of 2024, I joined the Technical University of Wien. My research interests are in the area of privacy-enhancing technologies. Before joining TU Wien, I was a student at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt and a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland. From 2012 to 2015, I was a professor at Saarland University, and from 2016 to 2024, I was a full professor at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg. My research has received several awards, including the Humboldt Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship and the Intel Early Career Faculty Award. I served as an independent (privacy) expert in the Health Committee of the German Bundestag.
