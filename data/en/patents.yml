        abstract: "A Computer-implemented method is provided for encrypting data by a server in cooperation with a predetermined number of rate limiters. The method includes receiving, by the server, a user identification, and a password to be encrypted and creating a secret message, the secret message being a key suitable for use with a symmetric key encryption/decryption scheme. The method further includes generating, on the basis of a predetermined interactive cryptographic encryption protocol, a ciphertext which encrypts the user password, and the secret message using secret keys of the rate limiters of the subset, where the threshold is smaller than or equal to the number of rate limiters, and the protocol is adapted such that the server needs only to interact with a subset of the predetermined size of the number of rate limiters for decryption of the ciphertext to recover the secret message."
